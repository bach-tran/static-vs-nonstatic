	 * Variable scopes
	 * 
	 * 	1. Class scope (sometimes known as global scope): any field that has the static keyword is class scoped. This means the variable belongs to the class itself.
	 *  2. Instance scope: any field that is non-static (does not have the static keyword) is instance scoped. This means that every single instance has its own copy of this variable
	 *  3. Method scope: any variable that is declared inside of a method is method scoped. This means that you can only access this variable within that particular method, and the variable
	 *  	is destroyed whenever the method is done executing. (this method exists within the stack frame)
	 *  4. Block scope: within methods, we can have different code blocks (if statement blocks, for loops, while loops, etc.) Variables that are declared inside of those blocks are only available
	 *  	within those blocks
